import turtle
turtle is a file within python. Inside the file is the class Turtle.
classes allow us to write turtle.Turtle(). We are calling a function called
init when we run this code. init creates space in memory for a new object of
the class Turtle. Our instance was called brad.

the class Turtle indicates the fact that it has a size and a color.
Individual instances of the Turtle will contain information about their
sizes and their colors.

calling function webbrowser.open() vs calling init when turtle.Turtle()

PART 6

class names should start with Uppercase
class defined in one file, use your class in another file
class = blueprint; can have data AND methods
instances of a class are examples like shrek

media is a file, inside, we made a class called Movie, then we created an
instance called Toy Story

 def __init__(self):
 self -- he instance we create, this created by default in python (self not a keyword but is standard language)
  self = shrek
  movie_title = "Shrek"

 instance variables -- unique to each instance of class Movie
 instance method -- a function that is defined inside a class and is
 associated with an instance
