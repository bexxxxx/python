PART 3
import turtle
turtle is a file within python. Inside the file is the class Turtle.
classes allow us to write turtle.Turtle(). We are calling a function called
init when we run this code. init creates space in memory for a new object of
the class Turtle. Our instance was called brad.

the class Turtle indicates the fact that it has a size and a color.
Individual instances of the Turtle will contain information about their
sizes and their colors.

calling function webbrowser.open() vs calling init when turtle.Turtle()
